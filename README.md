# process_invoices

This program parses a PDF with one or more pages of invoices, assumed to be generated by Quickbooks.

It extracts fields from the invoices: customer name, account number, invoice number, terms & email address.

For each page, it writes a single page invoice with a filename format: customer_name_invoice_number.pdf

If the page has an email address, then it emails the PDF as an attachment.

To cover special cases, it won't email customers that have EoS (End of Season) in their Terms.

An example invocation:
```
./email_invoices/process_invoices.py invoices.pdf -a link_to_oauth2.json
```

The program requires these modules to be installed:
* PyPDF2: allows reading PDFs per page, parsing the pages to get text, and write PDFs
* yagmail: yet another gmail client.  Allows sending from a gmail account using SMTP.

To install, do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/manningt/email_invoices
cd email_invoices
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install PyPDF2
pip install yagmail
```

# make_iif

Reads a CSV file which has a header row with the column titles customer_id & amount.

Writes a Quickbooks IIF file, which starts with the commented format of the fields:
```
!TRNS   TRNSTYPE        DATE    ACCNT   NAME    AMOUNT
!SPL    TRNSTYPE        DATE    ACCNT   NAME    AMOUNT
!ENDTRNS
```
and each payment generates the following lines:
```
TRNS    PAYMENT 12/28/2023      Undeposited Funds       Whitcomb, Andrea        35
SPL     PAYMENT 12/28/2023      Accounts Receivable     Whitcomb, Andrea        -35
ENDTRNS
```
