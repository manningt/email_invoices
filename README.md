# process_invoices

This program parses a PDF with one or more pages of invoices, assumed to be generated by Quickbooks.

It extracts fields from the invoices: customer name, account number, invoice number and email address.

For each page, it writes a single page invoice with a filename format: customer_name_invoice_number.pdf

If the page has an email address, then it emails the PDF as an attachment
